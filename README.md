# JSWorkspace
A collection of JS exercises and experiments.

The purpose of this repository is to act a container for various JavaScript exercises and experiments, in order to organize and showcase various learned concepts.

Where 'Master' is my own blank repl.it workspace (https://repl.it/@doomducky/JSWorkspace#index.js), each branch off of 'Master'
is its own unique workspace, showcasing a certain exercise or experiment (e.g. https://github.com/kyleperra/JSWorkspace/tree/transposeTwoWords).
